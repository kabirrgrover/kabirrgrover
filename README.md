# Hi, I'm Kabir 👋  
Computer Science at UMD • Builder • Founder Energy • AI + Full Stack + Fintech + Medtech  
  
I like shipping products, solving problems, and building things that actually get used. Most of my work lives at the intersection of AI, health, fintech, and consumer apps. I focus on creating systems that feel fast, reliable, and genuinely useful.  
  
## 🚀 Some things I am building  
  
### ClutchIt (iOS)  
A sports diary that lets fans rate games, write comments, generate AI recaps, follow friends, and build lists. Built in SwiftUI with a custom backend and data pipeline.  
  
### AI for Healthcare  
I am currently involved in medical AI research, focusing on ethical, equitable, and real time patient centered applications. I explore how AI can improve diagnostics, support clinical workflows, and create tools that adapt to individual patient needs.  
  
### AI for VC and Finance  
I am currently working on agentic systems that help people understand complex information, track insights, and make faster decisions. I like working on tools where AI reduces noise and increases clarity.  
  
### Ethics and Responsible AI  
I care about how to deploy AI in ways that are safe, fair, and grounded in real world needs. I think about transparency, reliability, and where automation should or should not be used.  
  
## 🔧 Full Stack Development  
I enjoy working across the stack:  
• Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript  
• React and Next  
• Swift and SwiftUI  
• FastAPI, Node, Firebase, Supabase  
• AWS and cloud infra  
• Databases and data pipelines  
  
## 📚 What I'm learning right now  
• Scaling AI systems  
• Exploring reinforcement learning, multimodal models, and large language models
• MCP Servers
• Better product design and UX  
• Modern mobile architectures  
• Ethical and responsible deployment of AI    
  
## 🎓 About me  
I study Computer Science at the University of Maryland with a minor in Innovation and Entrepreneurship. I like taking ideas from notes to real products. I try to ship something new every month.
